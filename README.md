# 🎤 Metaphor Generation with Billy Woods–Fine-Tuned LLM

This project explores whether large language models can generate or evaluate **metaphorical creativity**, and whether fine-tuning them on a **stylistically rich corpus** — in this case, the abstract, politically-charged lyrics of hip-hop artist Billy Woods — improves their performance.

> “A thousand plateaus, a constellation of prisons / An ocean of archipelagos, an algorithm…”  
> — *Billy Woods, “Wishing Bad”*

## 🧠 Project Summary

- Fine-tuned a **Mistral 7B** language model on the complete lyrical archive of Billy Woods.
- Prompted the model with metaphor stems like:
  - `A police badge is like...`
  - `A bullet is like...`
  - `A jail cell is like...`
- Compared completions from the fine-tuned model with a **base model**.
- Evaluated metaphor creativity using a **GPT-2–based scoring model**, trained on human-rated metaphor data.
- Reflected on authorship, voice simulation, and ethical implications of using AI to mimic human artistic expression.

## 🧠 Metaphor Scoring Model

The creativity scorer used in this project is based on a methodology from:

**Di Stefano, Peter, et al.**  
_"Automatic Scoring of Metaphor Creativity with Large Language Models"
[Paper link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400419.2024.2326343)

We re-implemented and fine-tuned a GPT-2 model using their dataset of metaphors rated by human annotators (-1 to +2).  
Our implementation achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.68 on the original test set.
